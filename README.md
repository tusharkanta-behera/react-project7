## 🎯 Overview

This application demonstrates a real-time text display feature where users can type into an input field and see their text rendered dynamically on the screen in large font. It's built with React.js and Bootstrap, making it a perfect starter project for learning React concepts.

## ✨ Features

- **Real-time Text Display**: As you type in the input field, your text is immediately displayed below in large format
- **React Hooks Implementation**: Uses `useState` hook for state management
- **Event Handling**: Demonstrates React's `onChange` event handling
- **Responsive Design**: Built with Bootstrap 5 for mobile-friendly layout
- **Component-Based Architecture**: Organized into reusable Navbar, Card, and Footer components
- **Clean UI**: Simple and intuitive user interface with a professional look

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **React.js** (v19.2.4) - Frontend JavaScript library
- **Bootstrap** (v5.3.8) - CSS framework for styling
- **Create React App** - Initial project setup
- **JavaScript ES6+** - Modern JavaScript features
- **HTML5** & **CSS3** - Markup and styling

## 🎓 Learning Objectives

This project covers the following React.js concepts:

- **React Hooks**: Implementation of `useState` for managing component state
- **Event Handling**: Using `onChange` event to capture user input
- **Component Composition**: Breaking down UI into reusable components
- **Props and State**: Understanding component data flow
- **JSX Syntax**: Writing HTML-like syntax in JavaScript
- **Bootstrap Integration**: Using external CSS frameworks with React

## 📝 Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder. The build is optimized for the best performance.
